### ¡Hola! 👋🏽👨🏽‍💻

Hi, I'm Emilio. I'm a software engineer from Mexico who is passionate about solving hard problems through technology and making products that create magical experiences for people.

Besides coding, here a few things I love:
- 🏄🏽‍♂️ Surfing
- 🏋🏽‍♂️ Crossfit
- 📚 Reading non-fiction
- 🎥🍿 Watching lots of movies

The technologies I work with the most are **HTML**, **CSS**, **React.js**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**. I'm starting to learn **Vue.js** 🤓.
